                <h2>Roadmap</h2>
                <p>Cara will start once we have finished the business plan in May 2022. We will first go to congress and talk about the company on social platforms like Discord, where many investors are always searching for opportunities. We will search for workers who can speak and write in English fluently, have a computer connection, and select them based on specific requirements. Cara will organize all the processes, talk to a lawyer, and set it up before getting the first office in Zug from May to September. The office will be open in September, with our selected workers and investors and our lawyers supporting us. We will provide our workers with the best tools to make their work experience efficient and offer a high success rate. During September, we will constantly surveil our workers and their performances. We will appreciate their feedback to improve the business; we will strictly monitor their success rate on requirements needed for presales. During the first 2-3 months, we will constantly analyze our workers and their performance. We will provide them with intense training to reach a moment where we will have a team built only of professionals who know what action to do for every project. With time, they could be the ones selecting future projects based on what they have learned from us. After six months, we would like to reach break-even on the initial investment. We start making a consistent profit for our operations investors and constantly increasing our profitability from that day on.

                <h2>Business plan</h2>
                <p> Cara’s value proposition will allow his customers to find investment opportunities with low risk and high returns and arbitrage within the new opportunities in the expanding sector of NFTs and cryptos. Cara is transparent on whatever transaction makes and will run a business-to-customer model, providing a certain percentage on the initial investment. What makes Cara different from all other competitors is that it invests in NFTs with a margin that you can not find elsewhere based on historical records of the last 7/8 months. The business will have workers constantly monitoring channels on social platforms such as Discord and Twitter for relevant information and use them accordingly if they could benefit. They will also use tools and software to increase their productivity by far. The need for a company that gives this high ROI has been proven through validation from surveys and interviews with the target customers. This business has been confirmed by the results of the founder and his experience in the past months.NFTs have the revolutionary potential for growth if investors and other workers join them. The company makes profits based on all earnings from investing the investor’s money.
